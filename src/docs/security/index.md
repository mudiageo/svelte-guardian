## Core Security Principles

Svelte Guardian is designed with security as a priority, following these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Secure Defaults**: Sensible default configuration that prioritizes security
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access limited to only what is necessary
4. **Authentication Before Authorization**: Verify identity first, then permissions
5. **Data Minimization**: Collect and store only what is needed

## Security Considerations

When implementing authentication and authorization in your application, consider:

- Regular security updates and dependency maintenance
- Comprehensive input validation
- Usage of HTTPS for all communication
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Regular security testing and code reviews

## Features to Implement

For a robust security setup, we recommend implementing these Svelte Guardian features:

- Email verification for new accounts
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Session management with secure cookies
- Proper route protection
- Audit logging
